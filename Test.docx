Gillingham F.C. is an English football club based in Gillingham, Kent. The club was formed in 1893, and played in the Southern League until 1920, when its top division was absorbed into the Football League as its new Division Three. The club was voted out of the league in favour of Ipswich Town at the end of the 1937?38 season, but returned 12 years later, when that league was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s Gillingham came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline set in, and in 1993 the club narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference.
